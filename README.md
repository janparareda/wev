# MP9 - UF2 Act2 - Image Optimization and Analysis in Different Formats

## Objective:

In this task, you will explore the impact of different formats and compression levels on images and learn to evaluate and choose the optimal format for each situation.

### Instructions:

As you can see, this code allows us to display some images and dynamically show some of their details with a fairly simple code. Analyze the different files to understand how it works.

### Task1: Images and Formats

- We will provide you with four images: "logotip," "plujaEstels" "postaDeSol" and "transparency". You will find them in the "images" folder of this task.
- For each of the images, you should create a new page. If you add any navigation options between them, it will be a plus.
- Your task is to export the images in different formats and different compression levels and analyze the results.

| Image Name   | Formats        | JPEG Compression Levels |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| logotip      | GIF, PNG, JPEG | 3 different levels      |
| plujaEstels  | GIF, PNG, JPEG | 5 different levels      |
| postaDeSol   | GIF, PNG, JPEG | 5 different levels      |
| transparency | GIF, PNG, JPEG | 1 (High compression)    |

- You should do it with Gimp or Photoshop but FIND AT LEAST an additional tool to do it and share it in your documentation.

### Task2: Analysis

While you're working on this task, you should document your findings in the same webapp you're given. You could use an html grid, a table, or any other method you think is appropriate. What you MUST INCLUDE is:

- General information about the image: size, dimensions, etc. must be visible as in the example.

- **logotip**: What format is the most optimal for this type of image and why? Can its size be reduced even more? Would it lose quality?
- **plujaEstels** and **postaDeSol**: What format is the most optimal for this type of image and why? With what compression quality does the image not lose quality? Can we reduce its size even more without losing quality? What would happen if we save the image several times?
- **transparency**: What is the most optimal format for this type of image and why? What happens when we save it in JPEG format? If our website has a white background, what format would be the most optimal and why?

### Task3: DeveloperTools and PageSpeed Insights:

- Start having a look at the DeveloperTools to analyze the loading of the images and the PageSpeed Insights to analyze the performance of the page.

1. DeveloperTools allow you to analyze the loading of the images and the PageSpeed Insights to analyze the performance of the page. Try to find how to fake a slow connection. How do image size and format affect loading time?
2. Check what PageSpeed Insights says about the images. What recommendations does it make? What is the impact of these recommendations on the loading time of the page?

Add your findings to each of the pages you have created.
