      What is the most optimal format for this type of image and why? What
      happens when we save it in JPEG format? If our website has a white
      background, what format would be the most optimal and why?<br />The best
      format for an image depends on how you will use it. If you need the image
      to be clear and keep its quality, PNG is good. It's because PNG does not
      lose quality when you save it. But, if you save an image as a JPEG, it
      might not look as clear. This happens because JPEG makes the image file
      smaller by reducing its quality. This can make the picture look a bit
      blurry, especially where the colors change a lot. If your website has a
      white background, using JPEG could be better because the file is smaller.
      This means your website will load faster.
